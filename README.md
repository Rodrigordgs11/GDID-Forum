# Digital Identity Management Practical Assignment: E-Commerce Application

This is an E-Commerce Application that integrates a Federated Identity Management System using a custom identity provider (IdP). It enables secure and seamless authentication for users across multiple platforms, allowing them to shop, manage orders, and access personalized features with a single set of credentials.

## Getting Started

To start the application, follow these steps to set up your environment variables:
1. Copy the structure of the `.env.example` file into a new `.env` file and complete it with the missing values:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2. Run the application:
    ```sh
    Docker-compose up
    ```

Replace the placeholder values in the `.env` file with the generated secrets.

You are now ready to start the application.
